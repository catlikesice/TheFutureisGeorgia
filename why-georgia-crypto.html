            <h2>Key Advantages of Being in Georgia</h2>

            <h3>✅ Zero Tax on Crypto Gains (for Individuals)</h3>
            <p>Georgia does not tax capital gains from personal cryptocurrency trading. This makes it one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions in the region.</p>

            <h3>✅ Easy & Affordable Business Registration</h3>
            <p>Set up as an Individual Entrepreneur (IE) and enjoy tax rates as low as 1% on business revenue under 500,000 GEL (~£140,000).</p>

            <h3>✅ Low Cost of Living, High Quality of Life</h3>
            <p>Georgia offers affordable housing, organic food, and a vibrant expat scene — especially in Tbilisi, Batumi, and Kutaisi.</p>

            <h3>✅ Crypto-Mining Potential</h3>
            <p>Georgia has a history as a crypto mining hub thanks to its inexpensive hydroelectric power and low energy costs in some regions.</p>

            <h3>✅ Legal Stability & Openness to Innovation</h3>
            <p>The Georgian government has embraced tech, blockchain, and digital transformation in public services — including blockchain land registry systems.</p>

            <h3>✅ Lenient Visa Policy</h3>
            <p>UK and EU citizens can stay in Georgia visa-free for up to one year, making it an ideal base for longer-term projects without residency headaches.</p>
